This repository contains scripts used in the manuscript
"Decoding stimulus identity in occipital, parietal and inferotemporal cortices 
during visual mental imagery""

The "Task" folder contains the scripts used to run the fMRI task. ASF toolbox (http://jvschw.github.io/asf/) needs to be downloaded for the correct execution of the scripts.

The folder "Scripts" are stored all codes used to perform feature selection, ROI-based and searchlight-based MVP analyses, and statistical assessment by means of permutation testing. Script for the searchlight-based MVPA are optimized to run analysis in parallel on the CIMeC SGE server.
